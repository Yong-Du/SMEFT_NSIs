This repository contains all plots in Appendix A (inside the `plots` folder) of [2106.XXXXX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.XXXXX) as well as some additional plots (inside `additional_plots`) that will show you the full constraints on all relevant dimension-6 SMEFT operators from each neutrino oscillation experiments considered in our paper.


Please cite our paper [2106.XXXXX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.XXXXX) and include this url `https://github.com/Yong-Du/SMEFT_NSIs/` in your slides if you use any of these plots presented here.
