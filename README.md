# SMEFT_NSIs

This repository contains all plots in Appendix A (inside the `plots` folder) of [2106.XXXXX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.XXXXX), a summary of all constrained dimension-6 SMEFT operators from T2HK, DUNE, JUNO, JUNO-TAO (inside `additional_plots`), as well as the uncertainty study on reactor neutrino flux from the Huber-Mueller model (inside `JUNO_uncertainties`) for JUNO and JUNO-TAO.



## PDF file name convention:

Experiment Name + NSI current type.

### For example: 

`T2HKNC1.pdf` means constraints on dimension-6 SMEFT operators that can induce NC NSIs from the T2HK experiment.

`T2HKAndDUNECCAndNC2.pdf` means constraints on dimension-6 SMEFT operators that can induce both CC and NC NSIs from a combined analysis of the T2HK and the DUNE experiments.
