Additonal plots not included in [2106.15800](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15800).

Each pdf file contains a full summary of all constrained dimension-6 SMEFT operators from T2HK, DUNE, JUNO, and JUNO-TAO (The fiducial mass of the near detector TAO of JUNO is assumed to be 2.8t.).

For JUNO and JUNO-TAO, we consider a 2%, as well as a 5% uncertainty on reactor neutrino flux from the Huber-Mueller model.
